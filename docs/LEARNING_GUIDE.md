## Problem-Solving Approach

### 1. Understand the Problem (5 min)
- Read carefully
- Identify inputs and outputs
- Clarify constraints
- Ask clarifying questions

### 2. Pattern Recognition (5 min)
- What pattern does this resemble?
- Have I seen similar problems?
- What data structure fits best?

### 3. Plan the Solution (10 min)
- Outline approach
- Consider edge cases
- Estimate time/space complexity
- Think of optimizations

### 4. Code the Solution (20 min)
- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for clarity

### 5. Test and Debug (10 min)
- Test with examples
- Test edge cases
- Dry run through code
- Fix bugs

### 6. Optimize (10 min)
- Can we do better?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Jumping to code too quickly** - Always plan first
2. **Not testing thoroughly** - Test edge cases
3. **Ignoring time/space complexity** - Always analyze
4. **Not asking clarifying questions** - Clarify assumptions
5. **Memorizing solutions** - Understand patterns instead
6. **Giving up too easily** - Struggle for 30 min before checking solution
7. **Not practicing interviews** - Mock interviews are crucial
8. **Studying in isolation** - Explain solutions to others

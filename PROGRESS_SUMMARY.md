## ⚠️ High Priority Gaps (Before Full Interview Readiness)

These fundamental patterns need implementation to reach 100% interview readiness:

### 1. Arrays & Strings (~30% of interviews) ❌
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Work**: 2-3 weeks

**Missing Problems**:
- Two Sum, Three Sum, Four Sum
- Product of Array Except Self ⭐ VERY HIGH
- Trapping Rain Water ⭐ VERY HIGH (Hard)
- Group Anagrams ⭐ HIGH
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters ⭐ VERY HIGH
- Minimum Window Substring ⭐ VERY HIGH (Hard)
- Valid Anagram
- String manipulation (reverse, palindrome, etc.)

**Why This Matters**: Arrays/strings are the most common interview topic. You need these basics.

---

### 2. Stack & Queue Problems (~15% of interviews) ❌
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Work**: 1-2 weeks

**Missing Problems**:
- Valid Parentheses ⭐ VERY HIGH
- Min Stack, Max Stack ⭐ HIGH
- Daily Temperatures ⭐ HIGH
- Largest Rectangle in Histogram ⭐ HIGH (Hard)
- Sliding Window Maximum ⭐ HIGH (Hard)
- Implement Queue using Stacks
- Basic Calculator

**Why This Matters**: Stack problems test your understanding of LIFO data structures. These are common warm-up questions.

---

### 3. Linked List Problems (~10% of interviews) ❌
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Work**: 1 week

**Missing Problems**:
- Reverse Linked List ⭐ VERY HIGH (Must know!)
- Merge Two Sorted Lists ⭐ HIGH
- Remove Nth Node From End ⭐ HIGH
- Copy List with Random Pointer ⭐ HIGH
- Reorder List
- Reverse Nodes in K-Group (Hard)
- Linked List Cycle (you have this in fast_slow_pointer)

**Why This Matters**: Linked list manipulation is a fundamental skill. "Reverse Linked List" is asked in almost every interview loop.

---

### 4. Partial Implementations (Need Tests)
**Priority**: MEDIUM

These patterns exist but need comprehensive test coverage:
- Two Pointer (4 tests only)
- Sliding Window (needs tests)
- BFS (needs tests)
- Backtracking (needs tests)
- Fast/Slow Pointer (needs tests)
- Heap (needs tests)
- Merge Intervals (needs tests)
- Union-Find (needs tests)
